# Reinforcement-learning-for-dynamic-systems-application-of-Fitted-Q-Iteration-methods-
This thesis explores the theoretical foundations of RL with a focus on offline and off-policy methods, analyzing in particular the Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) algorithm. A further contribution of this work is the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) to enhance the reliability of policy evaluation.
